# CS3300_project_2
Interactive Data Visualization focusing on different occupations in top 10 
cities in California and pay for each occupation changing over time. Visualization
also displays the contrast of different pay grades in different cities for the
same job. We are focusing on the question: where should I live in California
if I do occupation X? Which city offers the most bang for my buck?

Notes:
Sacramento doesn't have details for 2011 so consider shrinking time span 
to 2012 to 2015
